  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>My name is <strong>Athmakuri Tejaswini</strong>. I was born and brought up in <strong>Narasaraopet</strong> and currently reside in the same location.</p>

  <p>I hold a full-time <strong>B.Tech degree in Information Technology</strong> from <strong>Tirumala Engineering College</strong>, which I completed in June 2023 with a CGPA of <strong>7.1</strong> on a 10-point scale.</p>

  <p>My degree has equipped me with a range of skills essential for both my career and personal growth. I believe that <strong>hard work</strong> and <strong>determination</strong> can overcome any challenge. I'm also developing a habit of staying updated with current industry trends and news.</p>

  <p>As part of my academics, I worked on a project titled <strong>"Analysis of Various Machine Learning Algorithms for Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease"</strong>, which lasted for three months.</p>

  <p>And another project is <strong>Building a Portfolio Website using HTML and CSS</strong>. This project involved designing and developing a personal <strong>portfolio website</strong> to showcase my academic background, skills, and projects. The site features a clean layout, responsive design, and intuitive navigation which lasted for 1 months.</p>

  <p>I have also completed certifications in <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>JavaScript for Beginners</strong>, <strong>Front-End Development</strong> (Simplilearn, 29 Oct), <strong>SQL</strong> (IBM), and <strong>HTML</strong> (Great Learning).</p>

  <p>I scored <strong>90%</strong> in my 12th grade (Andhra Pradesh Senior Secondary, 2019) and <strong>85%</strong> in my 10th grade (Andhra Pradesh Board). During school, I developed strong <strong>communication skills</strong> and actively participated in extracurricular activities.</p>

  <p>I am skilled in <strong>DBMS</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, and <strong>HTML</strong>, and I am fluent in reading, writing, and speaking <strong>Telugu</strong> and <strong>English</strong>.</p>

  <p>I consider myself a <strong>quick learner</strong> and constantly strive to learn from my past mistakesâ€”something I believe is crucial for both professional and personal growth.</p>
